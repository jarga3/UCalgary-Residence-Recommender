# UCalgary-Residence-Recommender
An application that asks the user a variety of questions about their preferences to recommend the residence building and room at the University of Calgary that best suits their needs.


*IMPORTANT*
This project is still incomplete.

The UCalgary Residence Recommender is currently built on Python using Tkinter to create a GUI and the Pandas library. The GUI in my opinion is good for what it is, however I plan to flesh it out more and potentially turn the idea into a web application in the near future so that other students and prospective students at the UofC can benefit from it more. Right now, the function to calculate the room preference is incomplete. To finish it, I hope to explore the Pandas library by comparing the user's input's to the dataframe made from the CSV file to improve my understanding of Pandas and to make the cacluations well thought out and concise. 

The CSV file is a collection of my research on residence types at the UofC that I was able to find on the official University of Calgary website: https://www.ucalgary.ca/ancillary/residence/live-with-us/places-to-live.
